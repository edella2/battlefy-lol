# Battlefy Challenge

A simple application that allows a user to enter a player name. A user will then recieve stats related to their average total stats for kills deaths and assists.  They can recieve the same stats for each individual hero

## Considerations and notes for reviewers

I was having difficulty retrieving a champions name based on the champion ID from the LoL API.  I could not find which API call would return the champion name, which could then be used for displaying the correct name of the champion and the image next to each table.



## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the application: `npm install`
3. Start the server: `node server.js`
4. View in browser at `http://localhost:8080`
